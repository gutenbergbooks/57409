<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Once</span> let friendship be

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">A man</span> that is fit to make
a friend of must have
conduct to manage the
engagement, and resolution
to maintain it. He must use
freedom without roughness, and
oblige without design. Cowardice

be nauseous, passion is apt to ruffle,
and pride will fly out into contumely

<p>Even the utmost good-will and

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Think</span> of the importance
of Friendship in the
education of men. It
will make a man honest;
it will make him a hero; it will

the sincere with the

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">One</span> of the surest evidences

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">If</span> thou wouldst get a friend,
prove him first, and be not
hasty to credit him; for some
man is a friend for his own
occasion, and will not abide in the
day of thy trouble. And there is
a friend who, being turned to enmity
and strife, will discover thy reproach.
Again, some friend is a companion
at the table, and will not continue
in the day of thine affliction.</p>
